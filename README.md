# House Prices Prediction by MLR Model

# Project Overview
First-time home buying is currently a major federal issue. Prices for detached houses have been at an all-time high during the current COVID-19 period. This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. The objective is to develop a reliable predictive model that can estimate the selling price of houses based on various features.

# Data
## Source Data
Data for this assignment was obtained from the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) on detached houses in two separate neighbourhoods, one in the city of Toronto and another in the city of Mississauga. The data can be found in real203.csv.

# Results and evaluation
The Liberal Party is more popular among women and receives more support from highly educated individuals, single or never married respondents, and residents of Ontario and Quebec. The Conservative Party has nearly equal male and female support, is preferred by those with high school diplomas or college degrees, married respondents, and residents of Alberta. Age distribution is similar for both parties, with the Liberal Party slightly more favored by those 35 or younger. A generalized linear model predicts the Liberal Party would win a close election with about 28.37% of the votes, compared to 27.39% for the Conservative Party.
